# Virtual File System Organizer

## Project Description

This project simulates a virtual file system organizer to manage a collection of virtual files and directories. The application allows users to create, delete, move, and search for files or directories within the system. It does not involve any real file manipulation on the disk but uses in-memory data structures to simulate these operations.

## Core Features, Ideas, and Hints

1. **Directory Structure:** Utilize a binary tree to maintain a hierarchical directory structure.

2. **File Searching:** Implement a hashing mechanism to quickly search for files by their names.

3. **Path Resolution:** Use stacks or queues to resolve file paths and navigate through the directory tree.

4. **File Manipulation:** Implement functionalities to create, delete, and move virtual files or directories within the tree structure.

5. **Storage Visualization:** Provide a method to display the file system tree, showing all directories and files.


## How to Use

1. **Running the code:**
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```

2. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions:**

- Use the displayed menu to interact with the virtual file system.
- Choose options to create files/directories, move files/directories, search for files, display the file system tree, and more.

3. **Exit the Application:**

- Choose the "Exit" option when you are done.
